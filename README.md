### Author + Future Considerations

This App was written by Ryan Durk but there are still several places for improvement.

* High Scores should be sorted by highest score.

* Additional questions should be added and randomly given.

* High Scores should be accessible from the home page.

* Additional points should be rewarded based on time left.

* A limitation should be added to the what can be added to the initials column
